\description{
QuakeBox monologues are divided into intervals of fixed length within mean
values are calcualted for formants, amplitude, and articulation rate. Data
from 77 speakers is provide (the same sample as \code{qb_vowels}).
}
\details{
Two interval lengths are given: 60 seconds and 240 seconds.

Formant data is z-scored by speaker and vowel, while the amplitude and
articulation rate are z-scored by speaker.

Original data was generated for Wilson Black et al. (2023).
